# OpenBSD-Unofficial-Ports
Third-party programs I port and maintain for myself; along with some official ports modified.

## Installing
If you have not done so already, set-up your system for compiling ports.
You can learn how to do so here: https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/ports.html

Afterwards you can then copy a folder to the proper location.

Example:
net-rcon goes to /usr/ports/net/rcon

You can then do a simple 'make install' afterwards.

## Support
These ports will only support the latest stable version of OpenBSD.
