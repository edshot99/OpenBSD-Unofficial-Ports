Keychain is a thin cross-platform wrapper to access the operating system's credential storage in C++. Keychain supports getting, adding/replacing, and deleting passwords on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

On macOS the passwords are managed by the Keychain, on Linux they are managed by the Secret Service API/libsecret, and on Windows they are managed by Credential Vault.
